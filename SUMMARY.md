## Project Structure

- **app/src/main/java/com/example/partyofthepeople/**
  - `MinimalApp.kt` - The application class
  - `MinimalActivity.kt` - The main activity
  - `FreedomFightersApp.kt` - The main composable UI
  - **ui/**
    - **screens/** - All UI screens
    - **theme/** - Theme definitions
  - **viewmodels/** - ViewModels for screens

This minimal version should serve as a foundation to build upon while avoiding the Hilt-related errors.
