FREEDOM FIGHTERS APP BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

To resolve remaining build issues:

1. Ensure Material3 dependency is properly added in app/build.gradle:
   ```
   dependencies {
       // Other dependencies...
       implementation "androidx.compose.material3:material3:1.1.2"
       implementation "androidx.compose.material:material-icons-extended:1.5.4"
   }
   ```

2. Add the following import fixes in MainActivity.kt:
   - Import missing Icon components:
     ```kotlin
     import androidx.compose.material.icons.Icons
     import androidx.compose.material.icons.filled.Chat as Forum
     import androidx.compose.material.icons.filled.Flag
     import androidx.compose.material.icons.filled.Warning
     ```

3. The animateColor function may be missing from the current version of the animation library.
   The simplest fix is to use a static color instead:
   ```kotlin
   // Instead of:
   val backgroundColor by infiniteTransition.animateColor(...)
   
   // Use:
   val backgroundColor = ComposeColors.PatriotRed
   ```

4. Make sure you have the ComposeColors class in your ui.theme package:
   ```kotlin
   // In ComposeColors.kt
   object ComposeColors {
       val PatriotRed = Color(0xFFE63946)
       val PatriotBlue = Color(0xFF1D3557)
       val NeonWhite = Color(0xFFF1FAEE)
   }
   ```

5. If you need to use advanced animations, make sure you have the correct animation dependency:
   ```
   implementation "androidx.compose.animation:animation:1.5.4"
   implementation "androidx.compose.animation:animation-core:1.5.4"
   ```

If you still encounter build errors, simplify the implementation further by removing complex animations and focusing on getting the basic UI working first.
